## ok, what does all this shit do

The idea of Cut It is that the Organelle basically acts as a group of four pedals. The physical device itself should be rotated 90Â° counter-clockwise, and the buttons and knobs are split into four groups, one for each "pedal" (I'll call them "filters" from now on).

The filters and their controls are, from bottom to top:

- C4-E4 - sample / chop
- F4-B5 - filter / pitch
- C5-E5 - tremolo
- F5-B6 - reverb / freeze

The knobs also control stuff for the filters, and are selected by pressing the lower-left-most button of each group. (So for example, if I want to use the knobs to control stuff for the tremolo filter, I'll press C5 to switch them over to those controls.)
